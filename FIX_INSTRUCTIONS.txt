# Fix for your CMakeLists.txt
# Add usb-hid-kbd.c to your SOURCES section

# Before (your current):
set(SOURCES
  src/main.c
  # ...
)

# After (what it should be):
set(SOURCES
  src/main.c
  usb-hid-kbd.c
  # ...
)

# Make sure usb-hid-kbd.c and usb-hid-kbd.h are in your ~/Keyboard directory
# (at the same level as CMakeLists.txt, NOT in src/)
